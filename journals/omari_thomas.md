THE JOURNAL STORY

01/16/24
DAY 1

Story: We woke to find ourselves stranded on a deserted island. There were four of us myself, Lily, Noah and Daniel.
We quickly introduced ourselves and formed a bond, to survive was our main goal but secretly, I could see the spirit
to thrive behind their eyes.

Task: Successfully worked with team to organize files, get in sync, determine roles and organize game plan.

01/17/24
DAY 2

Story: We climbed to the highest point on this island. We needed to get a sense for the terrain and organize
our thoughts for survival. The ocean seemed so vast around us, waves crashed on all sides as if to stifle any
ray of hope.

Task: We had to rehash or wireframe. There were a few things we did not accommodate for in our original plan.

01/18/24
DAY 3

Story: The chill of the wind was particularly cruel today. After our scouting on the previous day we noticed
a small forest at the back of the island and last night, strange noise emerged from that direction. We decided
we needed a sense of security and tried creating some weapons and structural tents. We did not fully succeed this
day.

Task: Cleaned up databases migrations adding more tables and updating previous rows. Setup PGAdmin and started
working on endpoints for authentication...

01/19/24
DAY 4

Story: A shriek from the depths of the forest woke us. Frantically we huddled together for a sense of security.
As we found solace in the embrace of company we all noticed, simultaneously, Daniel was nowhere to be found.
Our guts churned and we made sure to create our weapons, pronto.

Task: We successfully created our backend authentication and discussed plans for the coming week.

01/22/24
DAY 5

Story: We decided to set up landmarks at the spots we most enjoyed on the island, of course, ignoring the forest
for now.

Task: Successfully created endpoints for liked episode (get, delete, create).

01/23/24
DAY 6

Story: We not only marked familiar locations but we created maps using landmarks and learned how to tell direction
based on our shadows. Lily is proficient with making sure the structural integrity of the things we created is secure
and Noah forever amazes us bringing back meat when I can only catch fish.

Task: We created endpoints for comments, tell_us_anything and did a overall review and update on all endpoints.

01/24/24-01/26/24
DAY 7-9

Story: We each had our own personal goals but know the island is an unforgiving place, so we needed to get stronger.
For the next few days we did strength training and weapon mastery.

Task: Studied figma, pytesting and algorithms

01/29/24
DAY 10

Story: We finally decided to arm up and venture into the forest to the North. Our breaths were in sync and we trusted
each other. We believed nothing could stand in our way.

Task: Started on front-end display and creating pytest.
