Today we finalized our database structure.  That took forever.  OMG.  But we have it and it's good.

16JAN2024
Today we setup the project on Gitlab, got the PostgresQL BD setup and got everything running on Github.
I then added the third party API code that I had completed last week and made sure it was working.

Today I was reminded of the journaling.  A lot has happened.  We've completed the API, Authentication, Frontend and our MVP is complete.

For me, my standout stuff was the API for Spotify and Apple, working out the DB stuff, and the liked_episode coding stuff(logic and animation) and also various bug fixes.  We all worked on the whole project and I am INCREDIBLY happy with the teammates that I have been randomly assigned.  I am blessed.

Today we are doing our presentation and and continuing to try and successfully deploy.
