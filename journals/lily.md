Today I worked on:

-   Drawing out the data structure

-   Setting up the project

Today the team created the project; set up the database; got our docker up and running; and started working api endpoints.

We were originally getting an error because our PostgreSQL services section was below our fastapi services section in our docker-compose.yaml file. So, today, I learned that the order of the services in the yaml file is important.
